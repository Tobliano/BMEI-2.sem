\section{Introduction}
Approximately 20~\% of the population suffer from chronic pain \cite{Macfarlanea2016}. The characteristic of chronic pain is a duration of pain more than three months \cite{Mello2016}. Due to the persistence of pain the patients get restricted physically as well as psychically. The patientsâ€™ ability to participate in diverse activities decreases. Those activities are not only physically but also socially. Like maintaining an independent lifestyle and relationships to friends and family can be affected.  Pain also has an impact on the work life, where 25\% of the patients changed job, responsibilities at job or lose their job due to chronic pain. Furthermore, depression was diagnosed in 21~\% of those patients. \cite{Breivik2006}
One of the most documented types of chronic pain is neck pain where  25~\% suffer from this in the UK \cite{Macfarlanea2016}. Those patients are restricted by negatively affected fatigue and concentration \cite{Zee2016}. Furthermore, they suffer like the majority of chronic pain patients from anxiety and depressed mood, cognitive distress and the resulting physical limitations. \cite{Gross2013}
At the moment there is no cure for chronic pain patients. The current treatment methods only provide possibilities to relieve the pain. \cite{Pope2017,Dawn2009} Nevertheless, the majority of the patients feels pain daily and this pain is increasing throughout the day due to the daily activities. \cite{Breivik2006} Chronic pain is mainly treated by medication. However medications have side effects like abuse or organ damage. To avoid those risks, alternative methods are used. One of those methods is mindfulness meditation. Whereby, meditation is used as mental training to achieve diminished judgment of emotions, cognitive control and existential insight. \cite{Dawn2009}
Previous studies show that mindfulness meditation provides the ability to enhance a broad spectrum of cognitive health outcomes. Furthermore, stress, depression and anxiety can be relieved. This improvements are due to the mental training achieved by mindfulness meditation. Especially because of emotion regulation, cognitive control, acceptance and positive mood. \cite{Dawn2009,Zeidan2012} Nevertheless, there are not many studies which show the effect of mindfulness meditation on chronic neck pain. \cite{Macfarlanea2016} Additionally, the pain relieve properties are mostly investigated after practicing mindfulness meditation over a time period of two months or more.  A shorter time period of mindfulness meditation has also shown to have an effect on pain relieve, but the amount of studies investigating neck pain is limited.
The present study addressed the question if short-term mindfulness meditation can relieve neck pain by measuring pressure pain threshold and pressure pain tolerance. Therefore the hypothesis "Short-term mindfulness meditation increases the pressure pain threshold and the pressure pain tolerance in the upper trapezius" was tested.

%********This is how is writen in the report*******
% The present study addressed if mindfulness meditation can alter pain sensation in the neck by measuring pressure pain threshold and pressure pain tolerance before and after short-term mindfulness meditation.
%Therefore the hypothesis "Short-term mindfulness meditation increases the pressure pain threshold and the pressure pain tolerance in the upper trapezius" was tested.
