\section{Results}
The tolerance for some of the subjects is not representative, as the examiner was not able to apply enough force with the algometer to reach the subjects' tolerance, thus those subjects were excluded. 

The Shapiro-Wilk test showed a normal distribution ($\alpha$ > 0.05) for the threshold and tolerance pre and post for both, treatment and control group. Therefore the two-way mixed ANOVA was applied. The test showed an equality of covariance (p = 0.955) and a equality
of error variances (p > 0.05) for threshold and tolerance pre and post. 
Whereby the pre and post measurements of threshold and tolerance were compared to see the  within-subjects effect.These results are illustrated in Table \ref{table:TWOWAYANOVA1}. The groups, treatment and control, were compared to see the between-subjects effect. These results are illustrated in  Table \ref{table:TWOWAYANOVA2}.

\noindent
The test indicates that there is a significant main effect between the pre and post measurements (within-subject effect, Measurement). However, no significant main effect is seen between the treatment and control group (between-subjects effect, Group), nor a significant main interaction between the measurements and the groups (within-subjects effect, Measurement$^{x}$Group).

The Shapiro-Wilk test showed a normal distribution ($\alpha$ > 0.05) for the difference in threshold and tolerance as percentage of the pre and post for both, treatment and control group. Therefore the T-test was applied. There is an equality of error variances for the tolerance (p = 0.159) and no equality of error variance for threshold (p = 0.013). The results from the T-test are illustrated in Table \ref{table:TTEST}.

The test indicates that there is no significant difference in the threshold and tolerance.
