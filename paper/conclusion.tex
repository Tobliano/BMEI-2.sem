\section{Conclusion}
Short-term mindfulness FA meditation on 5 consecutive days did not show a significant effect on pressure pain relief on the upper trapezius in this study. A significant effect was however found between Pre and Post measurement for both control and treatment, which was seen as an increase in pressure pain
Wherefore a clear conclusion on the effect of mindfulness FA meditation on pain relief cannot be stated. Nevertheless this study still contributes to the field of pain relief using mindfulness meditation as an alternative method. Since this study shows the tendency that mindfulness FA meditation increases both, threshold and tolerance, a longer period of practicing mindfulness FA meditation should be investigated. Furthermore, this study indicates that the effects of mindfulness meditation varies depending on the meditation technique. Hence the effects of the different meditation techniques should be further investigated in order to evaluate if different meditation techniques have various effects on pain relief.
