%\section{Protocol} \fxnote{Did we want to add something about asking them about the pain after each methods? or what did we discuss about this}
%This protocol will describe the present study, which consist of two experiments testing pain tolerance and pain threshold after practicing mindfulness meditation or after not practicing mindfulness meditation. 

%\section{Purpose}
%The treatment of chronic pain has constraints, as the treatments are only relieving the pain instead of curing the pain. Another issue is that some of these treatments, example medication, have side effect, as described in \secref{sec:treatment}. 
%There is alternative to medication such as yoga, hypnosis and physical therapy, psychological therapy and chiropractor, which have shown to have an influence on relieving pain. But these treatments are often used in combination with pharmaceutical treatment. Furthermore, most of these alternative require an external person to apply, which can result in high costs, as mention in \secref{sec:treatment}.
%An alternative to the present treatment is mindfulness meditation, which have shown an effect on relieving conditions as stress, depression and  anxiety through the ability to enhance emotion regulation, cognitive control, acceptance and positive mood, as described in \secref{sec:SOTA}. 
%Different studies have shown that practicing meditation have an effect on reliving pain. However, these studies have most often investigated long-term mindfulness meditation for patient with eater chronic pain or low back pain. There is a limit on studies that have investigated short-term in patient with neck pain, why this could be interesting to investigate further, as approximately 25\% of the chronic pain patients suffer from this condition. In order to investigated the influence of mindfulness meditation on pain threshold and pain tolerance for people with neck pain following hypothesis is proposed:

%Approximately 375 million people suffer from chronic neck pain. The primary treatment for those patients is medication. But medication has side effects, as described in \secref{sec:treatment}.  Besides medication, alternative treatment methods are used, often in combination with medication. For example physical therapy, chiropractor or psychological therapy showed a positive influence on pain relief. Most of the alternative treatment methods are related with high costs, because they require a specialist for the application. Whereas mindfulness meditation can be practiced alone. Hence a lot of studies focused on the ability of mindfulness meditation to relieve pain.
%As mentioned in \secref{sec:SOTA}, there are not many studies which show the effect of mindfulness meditation on chronic neck pain. Since a lot of people suffer from chronic neck pain this study investigates the influence of mindfulness meditation on neck pain. %Pain levels of chronic pain patients are not very easy to access and to quantify, therefore pressure pain was applied with an algometer on healthy subjects, 

%Pain levels of chronic pain patients are not very easy to access and to quantify because the pain is neuropathic and the assessment is multidimensional and the experience of pain is subjective. Therefore, in order to get some quantifiable measures on pain to clarify if mindfulness meditation will have an effect on sensitivity of pain, acute pain in the form of pressure pain was applied to healthy subjects. If the pressure pain tolerance is increased, after practicing mindfulness meditation, in the upper trapezius it might also have an effect on pain in other body parts. And if it is possible to show an effect on acute pain due to an increase in the tolerance on healthy subjects it might also be possible to help relieving pain in chronic pain patients. On basis of this the study wants to test the following hypothesis:

%***** This part should be more convincing ****
%Pain levels of chronic pain patients are not very easy to access and to quantify because the assessment of neuropathic pain is multidimensional and the experience of chronic pain is subjective. Also variation of the patients' pain from day to day and throughout the day makes it difficult to get reliable and comparable  values of the pain levels of these patients. Therefore acute pressure pain was applied with an algometer to healthy subjects to get quantifiable values of pain and test the following hypothesis:

\section{Study design} 
%For this particular experiment a parallel study was conducted. The subjects recruited for the experiment were randomly assigned in two different groups, the control group or the treatment group, with a equal amount of female and males in the groups. The control group consisted of twenty subjects no meditation. The treatment group consisted of twenty subjects meditation. The structure of the study design is illustrated on \figref{fig:studydesign}. 
%For this particular experiment a random controlled study was conducted. 

The subjects, recruited for the experiment, were assigned into two different groups. Whereby an equal amount of females and males were assigned. The treatment group was measured before and after the intervention, which was the practice of mindfulness meditation. To ensure that a measured effect was not due to habituation to the measurement, a control group was measured with the same time difference. Moreover, to minimize bias, the examiner was blinded. The structure of the study design is illustrated on \figref{fig:studydesign}.

\end{figure}  

%There will be seven to eight days between the measurements. The treatments groups start practicing mindfulness meditation three or four days after the first measurement and will then practice mindfulness meditation for five days and will on the last day of meditation be measured again.

%\section{Setup}
%The Pressure Pain Threshold (PPT), defined as the pressure at which the sensation changed from pressure to pain, has been recognized as an effective and reliable way to quantify pain measures. In this study PPT was measured using Wagner Force Ten$^{TM}$ Digital force Gage. PPT were measured in the upper trapezius. Testing points were marked to ensure reliable and rapid location during the experimental procedure. 
%The algometer was applied four times, two on the left side and two on the right side of the upper trapezius, and the average of the registrations was filed. The subjects had a 5 minutes resting time between measurements. PPT values were measured two times, the first day of the study and after 5 days since the first measure.

%\subsubsection{Mindfulness meditation}
%The treatment group should do guided meditation for 30 minutes in small groups for 5 days. On the first day the mediators would be giving a short introduction to mindfulness meditation. During the meditation the subjects would be in a sitting position with the face  away from the other subjects, to assure that they would not get distracted. 


\section{Procedure}
First of all, general information about the subjects were collected, such as gender and height and weight, which is illustrated in  \tabref{tab:subjectsA} and \tabref{tab:subjectsB} in Appendix \ref{SubjectINFO}. Furthermore, information about the experiment was given to the subjects. Measurement point was marked at the upper trapezius on right side, as illustrated on \figref{fig:trapezius} while the subjects laid prone to ensure reliable and rapid location during the experimental procedure. The location on the upper trapezius was determined between the acromion and 7th cervical vertebra. The distance was notated so the same locations could be used for each measurement session. 

\begin{figure}[H]
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/trapezius} 
	\caption{The measurement point on the right upper trapezius is mark with a black dot.}
	\label{fig:trapezius}  
\end{figure}  

The pressure pain threshold and tolerance were measured with an algometer (Wagner Force Ten ™  Digital force Gage). Firstly the threshold was measured, therefore the algometer was applied until the subject begins to feel the first sign of pain or discomfort. Secondly, the pressure pain tolerance was measured at the same point and the pressure was applied until the subject reached the maximum level of pain, until the subject could not stand it more. This was repeated three times and the average of these measurements was used for the pain threshold and pain tolerance. To avoid hyperesthesia, there was 5 minutes pause in between the repetitions. 

To test the effect of mindfulness FA meditation on pressure pain threshold and tolerance, the treatment group practiced 20 minutes mindfulness FA meditation on 5 consecutive days. To ensure same meditation conditions for all of the subjects, a guided meditation in form of an audio file was used. Furthermore, subjects were told to have the most comfortable position during the meditation.  Additionally a short introduction to mindfulness FA meditation was provided orally on the first day. 

The subjects of the control group continued their normal routine.
After the last meditation session of the treatment group the second measurements were conducted. The same time interval between the measurements were used for the subjects of the control group. The second measurement session was conducted likewise the first measurement session.


\section{Data Analysis}
First a Shapiro-Wilk test was applied to evaluate the normality of the samples. Thereby the sample scores are compared with the scores, which are anticipated under normal distribution. The Shapiro-Wilk test has shown to be valid even in small samples (n < 20), wherefore it was chosen for this study. \cite{Shapiro1965,Mooi2018} Afterwards a Levene’s test was applied to evaluate the equality of variances.

According to the outcome of the Shapiro-Wilk test and the Levene’s test, the parametric tests ANOVA and t-test were chosen.
The two-way mixed ANOVA was used in this study, whereby factor 1 denotes the group of subjects, either treatment or control, and factor 2 denotes the measurement session, either the first (Pre) or the second (Post). Therewith it was evaluated, if there is a statistical significant difference between those data samples, i.e. 
two kinds of variations were evaluated, the between-subjects variation in the factor 1 and the within-subjects variation in factor 2. 
Threshold and tolerance have been analyzed with separate two-way mixed ANOVAs. \cite{Mooi2018}

The t-test was used to compare the changes in threshold and tolerance between the measurement sessions of both, treatment and control group. Therefore the relative difference (Improvement) in threshold and tolerance between the measurements was calculated for each subject. Then a t-test was applied to the Improvements to test the mean difference between treatment and control group’s Improvement \cite{Mooi2018}. Threshold and tolerance Improvements have been tested separately. 

%According to the outcome of the Shapiro-Wilk test either a non-parametric or a parametric test was chosen.
%For comparison of treatment and control group with regards to threshold and tolerance of first and second measurement a Kruskal-Wallis test was applied in the case of a non-normal distribution and a two-way mixed ANOVA was applied in the case of a normal distribution.

% *** Add something about the factors we are using ***
 
%For comparison of treatment and control group with regards to the difference in threshold and tolerance as a percentage of first and second measurement a Mann-Whitney-U test was applied in the case of a non-parametric distribution and a t-test was applied in the case of a normal distribution. 

%*** Why you would also like to analyze the data in another way, and how the percentage exactly is defined.  Explain it more ***
