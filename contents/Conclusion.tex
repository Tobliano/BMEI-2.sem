Short-term mindfulness FA meditation on 5 consecutive days did not show an effect on pressure pain relief in this study. Nevertheless this study still contributes to the field of pain relief using mindfulness meditation as an alternative method. Since this study shows the tendency that mindfulness FA meditation increases both, threshold and tolerance, a longer period of practicing mindfulness FA meditation should be investigated. Furthermore, this study indicates that the effects of mindfulness meditation varies depending on the meditation technique. Hence the effects of the different meditation techniques should be further investigated in order to evaluate if different meditation techniques have various effects on pain relief.
