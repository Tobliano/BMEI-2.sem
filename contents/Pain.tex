\chapter{Pain}
The definition of pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage~\cite{Steeds2013, Mello2016}. Pain can be categories in acute, chronic and intermittent pain or a combination based on the pain experience~\cite{Goldberg2011}. 

Pain is a sudden or slow onset of any intensity from mild to severe pain~\cite{Mello2016}. Acute pain is anticipated or predictable \cite{Mello2016}. Contrary, is chronic pain not anticipated or predictable and has a constant or recurring of pain with a duration geather than three months~\cite{Mello2016}.


\section{Prevalence and incidence}
Pain is a world wide problem, as it has a high prevalence and incidence despite the complexity of quantifying pain\cite{Goldberg2011}. It is estimated that 20\% of the world's populations adults suffer from pain and each year is 10 \% of adults diagnosed with chronic pain~\cite{Goldberg2011}. Pain affects all populations regardless of gender, age, income, ethnicity or geography, but the distribution across the globe differs\cite{Goldberg2011}. 

The frequently causes of pain are operations, cancer, osteoand rheumatoid arthritis, injuries and spinal cord problems \fxnote{make the etiology of pain a complex transdiciplinary affair}~\cite{Goldberg2011}. Furthermore, can pain causes to different sequelae, such as depression, inability to work, limit social relationships and suicidal thoughts\cite{Goldberg2011}. 

People with chronic pain often complain of cognitive problems which interfere with their daily functions~\cite{Geisser2018}. Additionally, it is indicated that among people with chronic pain there are a consistent evidence for disturbances in attentional capacity, processing speed, and psychomotor speed~\cite{Geisser2018}. However, is the relationship between pain and cognitive problems unknown~\cite{Geisser2018}.

\section{Types of pain}
Pain is associated as a warning sign and is difficult to measure as the experience is subjective~\cite{Steeds2013} and is affected by previous experience~\cite{Ahmad2014}. The experience of pain is multidimentional, where the sensory discriminate ascpect involes intensity, quality and location of the pain~\cite{Ahmad2014}. The cognitive and emotional factors compose of subjective psychological variables, as attention, anxiety, fear, expectation and anticipation~\cite{Ahmad2014}. Pain can be divided into nociceptor pain and neruopatic pain~\cite{Steeds2013}

\subsection{Nociceptor pain}
Nociceptors, also known as tonic receptors or afferent nerve fiber\fxnote{tonic receptors: a sensory receptor that continues to trigger a response for minutes or hours after it is stimulated.}, are nerve cells which initiate the sensation of pain~\cite{Steeds2013, Martini2012}. Nociceptors are free nerve endings and have a high threshold for mechanical, chemical or thermal stimulation~\cite{Steeds2013}. There are two types of nociceptors $\alpha\delta$ and C fibers. $\alpha\delta$ fibers are very small, between 2-5$\mu$m, myelinated nerve cells, which produce fast well localized sharp pain~\cite{Steeds2013}. The distribution of these is in body surface, muscles and joints. C fibers are small, <2$\mu$m, unmyelinated nerve cells, which produce slow and poorly localized pain~\cite{Steeds2013}. These produce a burning or throbbing pain and the distribution of these is in most tissues~\cite{Steeds2013}. 

\subsubsection{Pain pathway}
Nociceptors are activated when a noxious stimulation occur and chemicals will be released by immune cells~\cite{Martini2012}. These are the factors that stimulate the nociceptors~\cite{Martini2012}. When the nociceptors are stimulated they will propagated the pain information to the spinal cord nearby~\cite{Martini2012}. The nociceptors will bring this pain information into the spinal cord from the dorsal horn and release neurotransmitter~\cite{Martini2012}. A second neuron, the second order neuron, will receive these information and cross over to the opposite side of the spinal cord~\cite{Martini2012}. The second order neuron brings the information towards the brain via the lateral spinothalamic tract~\cite{Martini2012}. This information will be transmitted by releasing neurotransmitters to the third order neuron in the thalamus~\cite{Martini2012}. The third order neuron is location and discrimination the pain~\cite{Martini2012}. The location of where the pain has occurred correlates to the area of the somatosensory cortex, as illustrated on \figref{fig:somatosensorycortex}. Pain on the right side of the body is processed on the left side of the brain and vice versa~\cite{Martini2012}. 

Pain is modulation by the descending pathways, where the Periaquadutal Grey (PAG) and the Nucleus Raphe Magnus (NRM) are involve in reducing pain~\cite{Steeds2013}. PAG, also known as anti-nociceptor, is important in the control of pain and surrounds the cerebral aqueduct in Mesencephalon~\cite{Steeds2013}. When this region is electrical stimulated it produce profound analgesia and injection of morphine, this can happen when PAG receives an input from the thalamus, hypothalamus, cotex and the collerates from the spinthalamic tract~\cite{Steeds2013}. Neurons from the PAG region excite the cells in NRM which have direction towards the spinal cord and to block pain transmission by the dorsal horn cells~\cite{Steeds2013}. Stimulation of NRM produce a strong analesia 
and release serotonin which activates the inhibitory interneuron and blocks the pain transmission~\cite{Steeds2013}. The key neurotransmitter are nordadrenaline and 5-hydroxyptamine~\cite{Steeds2013}. 

\subsection{Neuropathic pain}
Neuropathic pain or abnormal sensation is caused by primary lesion or motor, sensory or autonomic dysfunction of the nervous system.
The sensation is described as an sudden pain which is burning, tingling, shooting stabbing or numb and can be paroxysmal or continuous. The pain can be divided by the evoked pain into hyperalgesia, hyperpathia, hyperaesthesia, allodynia, and dysaesthesia. Hyperalgesia is pain of abnormal severity followed by a noxious stimulation. Hyperpathia is an exaggerated and prolonged response to stimulation, which can be delayed in onset and after repeated stimulation. Hyperaesthesia is defined as an increased sensitivity to stimulation. Allodynia is a painful response to a normally innocuous stimulus. Dysaesthesia is an evoked or spontaneous altered sensation is described as a discomfort rather than pain. 
If the abnormal sensation is caused by a damage in the peripheral is termed as neuropatic and if the damage is caused in the central nerves is termed central pain.
