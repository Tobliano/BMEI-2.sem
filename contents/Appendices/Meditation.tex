00:01 - 1:27: \textit{Hello and welcome, this is a guided focused attention meditation in which will be focusing our attention on the sensations we can feel around our natural breathing process. Our breathing is something we can always feel natural happening, and focusing on it can help us to be fully present and to take a break from focusing on thinking. I will say a couple of things about this meditation, and then you will hear a bell ring three times to begin. Sometimes, as we are trying to focus on the sensation of breathing we might find our mind getting distracted, and this is a total natural part of meditation, it does not mean that we are doing it wrong, all we can do in those moments is notice that we have been come distracted and without judging our selves, remember our intention to focus on the sensation of breathing, no matter how many times our attention wonders, we learn to just notice and gently bring it back to the sensation of breathing, it might help to keep our focus somewhere in the body where we can feel the sensation of breathing clearly. So now let focus on our attention on the natural sensation of breathing. It might help us to start out with a few deep slow breaths, filling our lungs with air, and breathing out worries attention.}
