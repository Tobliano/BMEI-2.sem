Therefore an experiment was conducted whereby the pressure pain threshold and the pressure pain tolerance of the subjects were measured by an algometer. After five days with 20 min mindfulness meditation each the pressure pain threshold and the pressure pain tolerance was measured again. To ensure that the difference between the measurements is not caused by adaption or habituation to the pressure a controlled trial has been performed and a control group has been measured with the same time difference but without mindfulness meditation.
This experiment was conducted to either accept or reject the hypothesis \textit{"Short-term mindfulness meditation increases the pressure pain threshold and the pressure pain tolerance."}.
