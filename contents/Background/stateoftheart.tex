\section{State of the Art}
Chronic pain have been investigated for years in order to understand the mechanism behind. Even though, is it still a relevant issue to explore as many people suffer from chronic pain. Furthermore, is it difficult to treat due to that pain is experienced individually. This also leads to an issue as the assessment of pain is subjective.

Currently, is there no cure for chronic pain only relieving treatments. The primary treatment is pharmaceutical, which may have side effects, such as toxicity. Alternative treatments, such as therapy, chiropractic and acupuncture have shown to have an impact on relieving pain, but only in a combination with pharmaceutical treatments. The alternative treatments have some disadvantaged due to high costs, why these treatment should be considered.  

Mindfulness meditation have proved to relieve conditions such as stress, depression and anxiety due to meditations ability to enhance emotion regulation, cognitive control, acceptance and positive mood \cite{Zeidan2012, Zeidan2016}. Studies have also investigated the usefulness of mindfulness meditation for people with chronic pain with similar results.
